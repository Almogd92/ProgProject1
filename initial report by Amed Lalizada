### Methodology 
My task was to analyze the question which was the number of previous attempts with the final results 
I used package used ggplot2 to in rmarkdown and I created a geom_bar graph to analyse the question and 
I made it for each module to make it clearer to understand and also showing the number of students 
that had previous attempts and the impact it has on the final results. 
I have performed some analysis to understand the distribution of the identifying attributes. 
The number of previous attempts.
Based on the analysis many students had 0 attempts. as it is almost the same in each module. 
These can be used to analysis its impact on the final results. 
 
 
```{r echo=TRUE} 
studentinfo <- read.csv("csv/studentinfo.csv", header = TRUE,sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE ) 
 ``` 
```{r echo=TRUE} 
ggplot(studentinfo) + geom_bar(aes(x=studentinfo$num_of_prev_attempts, fill=studentinfo$final_result)) +  
labs(title = "number of previous attempts in each module", fill = "final results", x="num of previous attempts", y="Amount of students") + facet_grid(~ studentinfo$code_module) 
```
