# First, set your working directory (see episode 'Analyzing Patient Data' for more
# info)
setwd("~/Desktop/r-novice-inflammation/")

# Import the data and look at the first six rows
carSpeeds <- read.csv(file = 'data/car-speeds.csv')
head(carSpeeds)


# The first row of the data without setting the header argument:
carSpeeds[1, ]

 The first row of the data if the header argument is set to FALSE:
carSpeeds <- read.csv(file = 'data/car-speeds.csv', header = FALSE)

carSpeeds[1, ]


 First - reload the data with a header
carSpeeds <- read.csv(file = 'data/car-speeds.csv')

carSpeeds$Color <- ifelse(carSpeeds$Color == 'Blue', 'Green', carSpeeds$Color)
carSpeeds$Color


To see the internal structure, we can use another function, str(). In this case, the dataframe¡¯s internal structure includes the format of each column, which is what we are interested in. str() will be reviewed a little more in the lesson Data Types and Structures.

str(carSpeeds)


carSpeeds <- read.csv(file = 'data/car-speeds.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(carSpeeds)


carSpeeds$Color <- ifelse(carSpeeds$Color == 'Blue', 'Green', carSpeeds$Color)
carSpeeds$Color


carSpeeds <- read.csv(file = 'data/car-speeds.csv', as.is = 1)


str(carSpeeds)


carSpeeds$Color <- ifelse(carSpeeds$Color == 'Blue', 'Green', carSpeeds$Color)
carSpeeds$Color


carSpeeds$State <- ifelse(carSpeeds$State == 'Arizona', 'Ohio', carSpeeds$State)
carSpeeds$State


carSpeeds <- read.csv(
  file = 'data/car-speeds.csv',
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE, 
  strip.white = TRUE,
  sep = ','
  )
